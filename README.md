# Movie App

This is a test project for General Assembly.

My primary goal when writing this was to keep the intent and action throughout the code as descriptive as possible. There is a lot of commenting describing what problems needed to be solved and how the code itself goes about solving that problem. I made an attempt to outline 'gotchas' to reduce frustration while learning and made sure to include code that is good for general use cases so they can use it in their own work if they are so inclined.

The comments describe **why** certain aspects of code need to be present and break down the build process somewhat chronologically to help the student understand the order and process in which this application was built so they may use it as a model for their own application-building ventures. The final solution includes important aspects of development like implementing error handling, giving user feedback through the UI, creating dynamic functions that take standardized and structured sets of data, API and URI basics, DOM manipulation, event delegation, and parsing data on the front-end as well as saving and serving static data from a server.

There are also a few 'EXTRA:' tags in the comments that are intended to give students something to think about and improve upon as they go through the code. There is a better implementation to be found, and what better way to learn than to try to improve upon someone else's code?
